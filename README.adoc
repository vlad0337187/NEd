Version 0.1, 10-JUL-2016

This is the initial release of a plain GTK3 editor with special support for the Nim programming language.
This includes syntax highlighting, fast check for errors, optional suggestions for identifiers and easy navigation to definitions.

My current local working copy already has multiview support, which is shown below:

=== Introduction

In first line this program is one more test and example of the https://github.com/ngtk3[GTK3 bindings] for the http://nim-lang.org[Nim]
programming language.

If you have no intention coding in Nim language and absolutely do not like the GTK3 GUI toolkit, then this software is definitely not for you.
In the best case you actually consider doing some GTK3 GUI coding, but that is optional.
And it should be clear that this tool can not compare with powerful editors like _Vim_ or _Emacs_ or proprietary editors.
Maybe in a later stage it can become comparable to _GEdit_, the default Gnome/GTK editor.

GTK is not very popular currently.
Some reasons for this may be that GTK is not really cross platform with native look and feel, and that it's
object oriented design coded in plain C is a bit strange. But on the other hand its C API makes language
Bindings available for many programming languages.

Current GTK3 bindings for Nim are not really high level. This means that the GTK3 widgets can not be extended
in the same way as Nim objects, and that it can be necessary to free objects or memory manually. Both is not
really a big problem, we can use _GObject_ macro system to subclass widgets, we can put widgets into Nim object or create
other references between Nim objects and GTK widgets, maybe with hash maps. Or we may use `g_object_set_data()/g_object_get_data()`
to extend widgets derived from GObject base class with custom data.
And manual memory deallocation is only 
necessary in rare cases, because GTK uses reference counting: Widgets are generally put into containers like boxes or windows -- 
when the containers are destroyed the children are unreferenced and destroyed automatically. This works not bad in C, and works
in Nim also. The low level structure of the current GTK3 bindings has the advantage, that the Nim code has the same
basic structure as C code, so the available C examples can be used as guides. For example this tool is based on
GTK_Source_View C examples and Gnome application examples.footnote:[https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s04.html#id-1.2.3.12.5]

Later we may create higher level GTK3 bindings for Nim, with easy extensible Widgets and Garbage Collection support.
It should be not too difficult to adapt our software then.

The biggest problem is unfortunately that we need some knowledge of GTK3 and the related libraries when we intent to
do serious GUI development. The C API documentation is really not that bad, but is large and learning it can take some
time and effort.

=== Install

Currently this editor is only tested on 64 bit Linux with GTK 3.18 (Gentoo AMD64).
You need a working Nim compiler and a working installation of Nim's nimsuggest tool.
And GTK 3.18 or higher and related packages, including GtkSourceView and maybe additional the related developer files.

Install through Nim's package Manager Nimble is currently not supported due to name conflicts with old
legacy GTK2 packages which are part of Nim's standard software base.

Open a terminal window and execute these commands (of course you may copy the commands to a file and then execute that file.)

bash ./make_it
----

The make_it build script is necessary because we have to generate resource files from the XML files for the GUI.
That script calls _gcc_, you may try to modify it for clang.

Maybe you want to try the included color scheme and syntax highlight xml file? In that case you may consult the gedit
instructions. On my Linux box I put these file where the other GtkSourceView files reside:

----
# as root
cp nimdark1.xml /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/
cp nim.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
----

That nim.lang file contains code to generate vertical bars to indicate indentation, which may look ugly with
other color schemes. For that case, just remove these lines at the bottom of file nim.lang:

----
<context ref="indent-pat0"/>
<context ref="indent-pat12"/>
<context ref="indent-pat8"/>
<context ref="indent-pat4"/>
----

Or you may try the syntax-highlighting file from https://github.com/nim-lang/Aporia[Aporia Editor].

=== Launching the Editor

----
./ned file1.nim file2.nim
----

=== Using the Editor

The title bar of the Gnome Desktop should display a NEd menu, which allows you to select fonts and color schemes.
Ned offers only very limited set of functions currently -- basically loading more files and saving content.

Most functionality is provided by GtkSourceView and related widgets, that includes text input, cursor movement,
scrolling, selecting text with the mouse and much more.

Right mouse button pops up a pull-down menu which offer `cut, copy, undo.`

You may enter search terms into the search text entry -- occurrences are highlighted immediately. Currently there is
no function to jump to next or previous occurrence

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

Shortcuts are not user customizable currently -- I am not sure if there would be a real advantage, but of course we may add that later.

Some keyboard support is provided by GtkSourceView, this includes

* kbd:[SHIFT Cursor Right] : Select text
* kbd:[F7] : Hide insert mark, allow easier cursor scrolling

The Editor itself adds currently these keyboard bindings

* kbd:[Ctrl D] : _Goto definition_: Place cursor over a proc name and press kbd:[Ctrl D] -- a new tab opens and
cursor jumps to that name. Later we may add variants of this functionality, maybe tooltip display of relevant block only.
* kbd:[Ctrl E] : Check source code for errors and mark these with gutter marks, underlining and tooltip description. 
* kbd:[Ctrl F] : Find (highlight) word under cursor or selected text. Press again to toggle. There is no jump to
next/previous occurrence provided yet.
* kbd:[Ctrl Space] : If cursor is located over a period, then nimsuggest tries to suggest _methods_. Try `1.2.` which
should offer `mim`, `max` and other float related proc names. If cursor is not located on the right of a period, then
GtkSourceView calls its word provider to suggest word completions. Type `pro` and you should get `procs`. These suggestions
do not work too well currently, some further investigations may be necessary.
