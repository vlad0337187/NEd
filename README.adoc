NEd is a simple GTK3 text editor with special support for the Nim programming
language. It supports syntax highlighting and permanent extended symbol info
displayed on the statusbar at the bottom like symbol origin and procedure
parameters. Checking for errors is very fast, and extended error information is
displayed as tooltips. Plain text search is supported by smart symbol search
with optional replace. For each symbol you can display its definitions with
source code. Splitting the display horizontally or vertically in unlimited
number of views is supported, including multi-view display of a single text
file.
